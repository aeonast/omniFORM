This codebase is designed for use with Xcode and openFrameworks 0.8.0. We do not
recommend trying to use it in other environments.


# Setup Instructions:

1. Clone this repository into an openFrameworks 0.8.0 build. Specifically, this
   needs to be located inside a directory that is inside the openFrameworks
   apps/ directory, e.g. of_v0.8.0_osx_release/apps/pinDisplays/omniFORM. This
   file nesting depth is necessary for relative file paths to work.
2. Follow the instructions in the file `localConfigsTemplate.h` to create a local
   configuration file.
3. Download to the openFrameworks addons/ directory any OF addons that you are
   missing. You can find these addons by google searching their name. You can
   determine which addons you are missing by trying to build the project and
   observing errors like "no such file or directory: .../addons/ofx<ADDON>/...".
4. If the project will not build after following these steps, please let us
   know.
